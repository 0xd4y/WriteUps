# HackTheBox Writeups

## Easy


### Bank

This is a really cool box that has a couple of interesting twists. I go through the unintended solution (the way I went about the machine) and the intended solution. There is a lot to learn here about web security and networking, and I highly encourage you to read this writeup.

### Bastion

A very realistic box with many things to learn. Misconfigurations can be a dealbreaker when it comes to a certain attack vector. There has always been a conflict between security and convenience, and this box highlights it. I go very in-depth about multiple aspects in this box relating to bastion hosts and credential databases. I hope you learn as much from this writeup as I did from this challenge!

## Medium

### Active

This was a fantastic box about the Windows Active Directory service. It showed the importance of managing your passwords in a secure way, as well as having strong passwords that are hard to crack. Thematically, this box involved abusing the way authentication is performed in an Active Directory. Something that really makes this box stand out is not so much the vulnerabilities themselves, but rather the reason why they are easily exploitable in the first place. Microsoft essentially made themselves vulnerable, as they spoke a little bit too much on THEIR OWN website! Come check out the writeup to see what I mean.
