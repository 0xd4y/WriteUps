# HackTheBox WriteUps

## Easy


### Bank

This is a really cool box that has a couple of interesting twists. I go through the unintended solution (the way I went about the machine) and the intended solution. There is a lot to learn here about web security and networking, and I highly encourage you to read this writeup.

### Bastion

A very realistic box with many things to learn. Misconfigurations can be a dealbreaker when it comes to a certain attack vector. There has always been a conflict between security and convenience, and this box highlights it. I go very in-depth about multiple aspects in this box relating to bastion servers and credential databases. I hope you learn as much from this writeup as I did from this challenge!
