## Welcome to 0xd4y WriteUps!

Here I publish all my writeups primarily from TryHackMe and HacktheBox. I tend to go in-depth about the exploits, and give you good resources to where you can learn more about a specific topic.
When going through a box, I always try to root the box (even if it is not intended). This can lead to some very interesting discoveries on how the whole box was created. Some may be surprised to hear that sometimes the creator of a box has easter eggs laying around the system!

I hope you can all learn a lot from reading my writeups. If anybody has any suggestions or comments, please feel free to contact me: djxevis@gmail.com

## TryHackMe

<a href="https://0xd4y.github.io/WriteUps/TryHackMe">TryHackMe</a> tends to have easier challenges than HacktheBox, but sometimes there are boxes that can prove to be a real challenge. In any case, there is a lot to learn from <a href="https://tryhackme.com">https://tryhackme.com</a>, and I encourage anybody to try the website out.

### Avengers (Easy)

A fun CTF-like box with an easter egg and cool (unintended) foothold. I root this box in a quite unique way, which the author of the box certainly did not intend.

### Keldagrim (Medium)

A realistic box. Many things were learned during this challenge, and I highly recommend reading this writeup.
